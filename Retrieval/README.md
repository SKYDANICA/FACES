# Experiment Steps

## 1. Build Retrieval Vectors
After setting up the environment, first run the `build_voc.py` file to build the retrieval vectors.
```bash
python build_voc.py
```
## 2. Perform Retrieval
Next, run the Retriver.py file to perform the retrieval operation.
```bash
python Retriver.py
```

## 3. Data Processing
Finally, run the process.py file to facilitate easier use of the data in the future.
```bash
python process.py
```
